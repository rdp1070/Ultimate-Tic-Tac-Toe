# Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe
A small game made in JavaScript. 

How To: 
Player 1 plays in any small box on the screen. When the first player enters their move, 
it will restrict placement of player 2's move to the large game that corresponds with it. 
i.e. Player 1 plays in the top left corner of the bottom right large game. This means player
2's next move must be in the top left large game.
